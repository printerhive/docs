## June 2, 2025

*   **Major Feature Launch: Klipper Support**
    *   **Klipper Integration:** Printerhive now officially supports Klipper-based printers alongside Bambu Lab printers, creating a unified interface to manage multi-vendor printer fleets.
    *   **Remote Access without VPN:** Users can securely access and control their Klipper printers from anywhere in the world without needing to configure a VPN or open ports.
    *   **Seamless Integration:** The integration is designed to be seamless. Users can continue to use their existing Klipper interface (e.g., Mainsail/Fluidd) as usual. Printerhive mirrors all data, ensuring no loss of functionality or history.
    *   **Free Testing Period:** To celebrate the launch, all accounts (including Free tier) can connect and manage an unlimited number of Klipper printers until July 9, 2025. After this date, standard account limits will apply to the total number of printers (both Klipper and Bambu Lab).
    *   **Initial Klipper Features & Known Limitations:**
        *   **Current Functionality:** Users can upload individual gcode files to Printerhive and initiate prints on their Klipper machines.
        *   **Ongoing Development:** Full feature parity is in active development. Features being finalized in the coming days/weeks include:
            *   Direct print submission from OrcaSlicer via Printerhive.
            *   Multi-plate 3mf file support.
            *   Advanced printer controls (nozzle, fans, flow, motors, Z-tilt).
            *   Support for multi-material systems.

## May 16, 2025

*   **Feature Updates & Enhancements:**
    *   **New "Reserved" Printer Status:** Introduced support for a non-standard "Reserved" printer status. This status is displayed on a printer after a print job is sent to it and remains active until the printer physically starts printing. This enhancement helps users easily identify which printers are already allocated for upcoming jobs, simplifying queue management for sequential prints.
    *   **Persistent Column Visibility in Print Jobs:** Column visibility settings (show/hide) in all three Print Jobs sections (Queue, Current, History) are now saved per user. These preferences are preserved across devices and sessions and will no longer reset to their default state. (Note: Separate settings for PC/Tablet/Mobile can be considered for future implementation based on user requirements.)
    *   **Plate Identification in File Detail View:** Plate names or numbers are now displayed above their respective images in the print file detail view. If a plate name is too long to fit, the full name will be shown on hover.

*   **UI/UX Changes:**
    *   **Print Job Submission Redirect Update:** The redirect behavior after sending a file to print has been temporarily changed. Users are now redirected to the print **Queue** section instead of the "Current Prints" section.
    *   **Print Configuration Button Renamed:** The "Save" button within the print configuration dialog has been renamed to "Save to Queue" to better reflect its action.

*   **API & Backend Improvements:**
    *   **Print Job Status Accuracy:** Improved API logic to address an issue where print jobs sometimes remained in the "Current Prints" section even after they had actually finished. Completed jobs should now be correctly and promptly moved to history.

## February 6, 2025

*   **Locations Feature Launch:** You can now add, edit, and delete Locations.
    *   **Purpose:** Organize printers linked to specific clients (e.g., different floors, home vs. work). Each location requires an assigned client, but a client can manage multiple locations.
    *   **Benefits:** Enables moving printers between locations (clients) easily. Future updates will include filtering printers by location.
    *   **API Keys:** Client API keys are now managed and viewed within their assigned Location settings. Each client retains its unique API key.

## February 3, 2025

*   Completed the final major backend update, introducing the underlying structure for the upcoming "Locations" feature. (Note: Location management UI is not yet available).
*   Added a **Reset** button for print jobs stuck in the "Preparing to Print" state. This allows users to return the job to the queue and free up the printer if it becomes unresponsive before starting a print.

## February 2, 2025

*   Addressed an issue causing frequent user logouts.
*   Deployed a significant backend update in preparation for upcoming features. (This was the second major infrastructure update). Users are encouraged to report any unexpected issues.
