# Notifications

Printerhive features a comprehensive notification system to keep you informed about your printer's activity.

## Key Features:

*   **Multi-Device Support:** Enable notifications on multiple devices. Alerts will be delivered to all enabled devices simultaneously, even if the Printerhive app is closed.
*   **In-App Alerts:** Receive notifications directly within the app while you are browsing.
*   **Notification Center:** The bell icon (typically located in the bottom left corner) displays notifications from the last 24 hours. Clicking the bell icon opens the notification panel and marks all displayed notifications as read.
*   **Notification History:** Access a detailed history of your notifications by clicking "View All" in the notification panel or navigating through your profile settings. You can view notifications from the past 24 hours, the last week, or the last month.
