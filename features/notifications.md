# Notifications

Printerhive features a comprehensive notification system to keep you informed about your printer's activity and important events.

## Key Features:

*   **Multi-Device Support:** Enable notifications on multiple devices. Alerts will be delivered to all enabled devices simultaneously, even if the Printerhive app is closed.
*   **In-App Alerts:** Receive notifications directly within the app while you are browsing.
*   **Notification Center:** The bell icon (typically located in the bottom left corner) displays notifications from the last 24 hours. Clicking the bell icon opens the notification panel and marks all displayed notifications as read.
*   **Notification History:** Access a detailed history of your notifications by clicking "View All" in the notification panel or navigating through your profile settings. You can view notifications from the past 24 hours, the last week, or the last month.

## Configurable Notification Events

Printerhive allows you to configure alerts for a variety of events, ensuring you are notified about what matters most to you. Common examples include:

*   **Print Completion:** Get an alert when a print job finishes.
*   **Print Errors & Issues:** Be notified immediately if a printer encounters an error or an issue requires your attention.
*   **Low Material Alerts:** Receive warnings when filament is running low (requires printer/AMS support for this data).
*   **Abnormal Value Warnings:** Set up notifications for unusual readings, such as unexpected temperature fluctuations or print speed deviations (feature may vary based on printer capabilities and plan).
*   **Other Important Events:** Depending on your setup and plan, other specific event notifications might be available.

Details on how to configure which notifications you receive can typically be found in your account settings or notification settings within the Printerhive application.
