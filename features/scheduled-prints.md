# Scheduled Prints

Printerhive allows you to schedule print jobs to start at a specific time in the future.

## Managing Scheduled Jobs:

*   **Scheduling:** When sending a print job, you can specify a future start time.
*   **Editing:** You can modify the scheduled start time and preheating settings for jobs that haven't started yet. Your preferred preheating settings for scheduled jobs can be saved for future use.
*   **Cancelling:** If you need to cancel a scheduled print before it begins, you can do so. Cancelling the job will return it to the print queue and automatically turn off the printer's preheating if it was activated specifically for that job.
