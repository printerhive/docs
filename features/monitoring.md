# Monitoring

Printerhive offers robust real-time monitoring for all your connected 3D printers, allowing you to stay informed about their status and print progress from anywhere.

## Key Monitoring Capabilities

Printerhive provides a comprehensive suite of monitoring tools, including:

*   **Live Temperature Tracking:** Monitor print head and bed temperatures in real-time.
*   **Detailed Print Progress:** Keep track of the current layer, overall progress percentage, estimated remaining time (if provided by the printer), and material consumption.
*   **Printer Status Updates:** See the current operational status of each printer (e.g., printing, idle, error, offline).
*   **Camera Feeds:** View live video streams from your printer's camera (if available and configured). Refer to guides like [Activating Camera for Bambu Lab X1 & H2D](/guides/activating-camera-bambu-lab-x1-h2d.md) for specific setups.
*   **Error and Issue Alerts:** Receive notifications for printer errors or issues that require attention. (See [Notifications](/features/notifications.md) for more details on setting up alerts).
*   **AMS / Material Monitoring:** For printers with Automatic Material Systems (AMS), monitor the status of individual filament slots, including type, color, and remaining amount (if supported by the printer and AMS version).

## Accessing Monitoring Information

You can access printer monitoring data in several convenient locations within the Printerhive application:

1.  **Main Dashboard:** Get an at-a-glance overview of all connected printers, their current status, and key print information.
2.  **Printer Detail View:** Select a specific printer to see its detailed monitoring page, including temperature graphs, full print job details, and camera feed.
3.  **Mobile Accessibility:** Printerhive is designed to be responsive, allowing you to monitor your printers effectively from desktop, tablet, or mobile devices.

## Camera Integration for Visual Monitoring

Visual monitoring is a key aspect of managing a print farm remotely. Printerhive supports:

*   **Integrated Camera Feeds:** Direct display of camera streams from compatible printers (e.g., Bambu Lab printers with LAN mode camera streaming enabled).
*   **Future Enhancements:** We are continuously working on expanding camera compatibility and features, such as potential support for IP cameras or time-lapse recordings. Stay tuned to our [Changelog](/changelog/) for updates.

_(Note: Specific monitoring features and their availability may depend on the printer model, its firmware, and your Printerhive plan.)_
