# Locations

The Locations feature helps you organize your printers, especially if you manage printers in different physical places or associated with different client installations.

## Key Concepts:

*   **Purpose:** Group printers logically (e.g., by floor, building, home vs. office). Each Location is linked to a specific Printerhive client instance running on a device like a Raspberry Pi.
*   **Client Association:** While each Location needs one assigned client, a single client installation can potentially manage printers across multiple logical Locations if needed (though typically one client per physical location is standard).
*   **Management:** You can add, edit, and delete Locations through the Printerhive interface.
*   **Printer Assignment:** Easily move printers between different Locations (and thus, potentially different managing clients) as needed.
*   **API Keys:** Client API keys, used for connecting the client software to your Printerhive account, are managed and viewed within the settings of their assigned Location.

## Benefits:

*   **Organization:** Keep your printer list tidy and understandable.
*   **Simplified Management:** Streamlines managing printers linked to specific client installations.
*   **Future Filtering:** Planned updates will allow filtering your printer dashboard and other views based on Location.
