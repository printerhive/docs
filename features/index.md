# Features Overview

Printerhive is designed to streamline the management of multiple Bambulab 3D printers, helping you save time and automate routine tasks, all from a single, centralized platform. Whether you're running a small hobby farm or a larger business operation, Printerhive offers features to enhance your workflow.

## Core Capabilities

Printerhive provides a suite of tools focused on efficiency and control:

*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Keep an eye on all your printers simultaneously. View live status, temperatures, print progress, material consumption, and camera feeds directly on your dashboard.
*   **Intelligent Print Queue & Scheduling:** Manage your prints effectively. Prioritize jobs, schedule them for specific times, and automate repeat prints to optimize printer utilization.
