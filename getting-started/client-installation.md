# Client Installation

Before proceeding with the installation, please ensure your hardware meets the [Hardware Requirements](./hardware-requirements.md) and that you have prepared your Raspberry Pi device following the [Prepare Raspberry Pi](./prepare-raspberry-pi.md) guide.

## Installation Steps

1.  **Connect via SSH:** Access the command line of your device using SSH. Instructions for connecting from Windows, macOS, and Linux are included at the end of the [Preparing Raspberry Pi OS Lite guide](./prepare-raspberry-pi.md#_10-power-on-and-connect).

2.  **Run the Installation Script:** Log in to the Printerhive web application and follow the interactive [Installation Guide](/getting-started/installation_guide). The guide will provide you with a specific command to run on your Raspberry Pi via SSH.
    *   **Recommended Method:** Copy the command directly from the web application's installation guide. This command usually includes your unique API key, simplifying the process.
    *   **Alternative Method:** If you prefer or need to run a generic command, you can use the following. Note that if you use this method, you **will** need to manually provide the API key when prompted (see Step 3).
        ```bash
        curl -s https://app.printerhive.com/setup -o setup.sh && sudo bash setup.sh
        ```

3.  **Provide API Key (If Necessary):**
    *   If you used the **alternative method** in Step 2, the script will prompt you to enter your API key.
    *   **How to find your API key:**
        *   Log in to your Printerhive account: [https://app.printerhive.com](https://app.printerhive.com)
        *   Navigate to the **Locations** section.
        *   Find your location and click the **eye icon** (üëÅÔ∏è) next to the API Key to reveal it.
        *   **Double-click** the revealed API key to select the entire key, then copy it (e.g., using `Ctrl+C` or `Cmd+C`).
        *   Paste the copied **API key** into the SSH terminal when prompted (e.g., using right-click, `Shift+Insert`, or `Cmd+V`, depending on your terminal) and press Enter.
    *   If you used the recommended command from the web guide (Step 2), it should already contain the key, and you might not be prompted for it separately.

4.  **Wait for Completion:** The installation process may take several minutes, potentially up to 40 minutes on slower devices like Raspberry Pi Zero (refer to the [Hardware Requirements](./hardware-requirements.md#supported-devices) for performance examples).

5.  **Installation Complete:** Once the script finishes, the Printerhive client is installed and running. You can monitor its status and proceed with adding printers in the Printerhive web application. You can close the SSH connection.

## Troubleshooting Installation Issues

The following issues may occur during installation:

*   **Incorrect or invalid API Key:** If you entered the API key manually (using the alternative installation method), ensure you copied it completely and without errors. You can find your API key in the Printerhive web application under the "Locations" section.
*   **Unstable internet connection:** The installation script downloads necessary packages and Docker images. If your internet connection is unstable or slow, a download error may occur, and the installation will fail. Ensure a stable internet connection for the Raspberry Pi throughout the installation.
*   **Insufficient SD card space:** Make sure you have enough free space on your SD card. Minimum SD card size requirements are listed in the [Hardware Requirements](./hardware-requirements.md) section.
*   **Permission issues:** The installation script requires `sudo` privileges for some operations. Run the command as instructed, typically with `sudo bash setup.sh`.
*   **Power interruption:** A sudden power loss to the Raspberry Pi during installation can lead to an inconsistent state and installation failure.
*   **Previous failed installation:** If you are attempting to reinstall after a previous failure, fragments may remain on the system that cause conflicts. In such cases, the simplest solution might be to start with a fresh installation of Raspberry Pi OS.

If problems persist, we recommend checking the installation script's output for specific error messages that might indicate the cause of the problem.
